# Cloud Provider Overview

Even if you have experience working with any cloud provider, you might still have some questions about how to choose services that fits with the budget. And selecting a provider is subjective. For example, some people are familiar and loyal to one provider over another.

When it comes to business, you have to look beyond the brand and find what is best for your organization and your customers. Here is a checklist for these comparisons:

- **Find a reliable provider**. This goes beyond name recognition to include emphasis on security and feedback from real customers.
- **Evaluate stability**. That means availability of regular releases, continuous performance, dispersed reach, fault tolerance and load balancing.
- **Consider economies of scale**. What is the ratio between the cost of running an enterprise on-premise server versus the available resources of an enterprise cloud-based?
- **Look for standardized service**. Does the company offer cost-effective bundles of apps and the resources you need? Bundled services can save 40 percent over purchasing a la carte IaaS, SaaS, and other digital products.
- **Evaluate flexibility**. Does the provider increase agility and growth for your organization?
