# Cloud Provider Compute

## AWS Compute

AWS flagship compute service is Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). It offers a wide variety of options, including a huge assorment of instances, support for both of Windows and Linux, bare metal instances, GPU instances, high-performance computing, auto scalling and more. AWS also provide a free tier for EC2 that includes 750 hours per month for up to 12 months.

Fargate is container service and cluster management that support Docker and Kubernetes.

AWS also offers a virtual private cloud option known as Lightsail, Batch for batch computing jobs, Elastic Beanstalk for deploying and scaling Web Application and many other well services.

## Azure Compute

Azure primary compute service is known as Virtual Machines. It supports for Linux, Windows Server, SQL Server, Oracle, IBM and SAP, including GPU and high-performance computing options, optimized for AI/ML, as well as enhanced security, hybrid cloud capabilities and integrated support for Microsoft software.

It also has a free tier with 750 hours/month of Windows or Linux B1S VM for a year.

Virtual Machine Scale Sets is Virtual Machine with Auto Scalling capability.

Azure has two container services: Azure Container Service is based on Kubernetes, and Container Services uses Docker Hub and Azure Container Registry for management. It has a Batch service, and Cloud Services for scalable Web applications is similar to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. It also has a unique offering called Service Fabric that is specifically designed for applications with microservices architecture.

## GCP Compute

Google's catalog of compute services is somewhat shorter than its competitors'. Its primary service is called Compute Engine, which boasts both custom and predefined machine types, per-second billing, Linux and Windows support, automatic discounts and carbon-neutral infrastructure that uses half the energy of typical data centers. It offers a free tier that includes one f1-micro instance per month for up to 12 months.

Google has been heavily involved and focused in the Kubernetes project, giving it the most advantage in containers and microservices area.
