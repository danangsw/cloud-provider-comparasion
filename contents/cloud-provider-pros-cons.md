# Cloud Provider Overall Pros and Cons

## Amazon Web Services

Amazon's biggest strength is its dominance of the public cloud market. As Gartner noted, "AWS has been the market share leader in cloud IaaS for over 10 years."

AWS has a huge and growing array of available services, as well as the most comprehensive network of worldwide data centers. The Gartner report summed it up, saying, "AWS is the most mature, enterprise-ready provider, with the deepest capabilities for governing a large number of users and resources."

Amazon's big weakness relates to pricing. While AWS regularly lowers its prices, many enterprises find it difficult to understand the company's cost structure and to manage those costs effectively when running a high volume of workloads on the service.

### Pros

- Dominant market position
- Extensive, mature offerings
- Support for large organizations
- Extensive training
- Global reach

### Cons

- Difficult to use
- Cost management
- Overwhelming options

## Microsoft Azure
Many enterprises deploy Windows and other Microsoft software. Because Azure is tightly integrated with these other applications, enterprises that use a lot of Microsoft software often find that it also makes sense for them to use Azure. This builds loyalty for existing Microsoft customers. Also, if you are already an existing Microsoft enterprise customer, expect significant discounts off service contracts.

Gartner finds fault with some of the platform's imperfections. "While Microsoft Azure is an enterprise-ready platform, Gartner clients report that the service experience feels less enterprise-ready than they expected, given Microsoft's long history as an enterprise vendor," it said. "Customers cite issues with technical support, documentation, training and breadth of the ISV partner ecosystem."

### Pros

- Second largest provider
- Integration with Microsoft tools and software
- Broad feature set
- Hybrid cloud
- Support for open source

### Cons
- Issues with documentation
- Incomplete management tooling

## Google Cloud Platform
Google has a strong offering in containers, since Google developed the Kubernetes standard.

GCP specializes in high compute offerings like Big Data, analytics and machine learning. It also offers considerable scale and load balancing â€“ Google knows data centers and fast response time.

GCP doesn't offer as many different services and features. It also doesn't have as many global data centers as AWS or Azure, although it is quickly expanding.

Gartner said that its "clients typically choose GCP as a secondary provider rather than a strategic provider, though GCP is increasingly chosen as a strategic alternative to AWS by customers whose businesses compete with Amazon, and that are more open-source-centric or DevOps-centric, and thus are less well-aligned to Microsoft Azure."

### Pros

- Designed for cloud-native businesses
- Commitment to open source and portability
- Deep discounts and flexible contracts
- DevOps expertise

### Cons

- Late entrant to IaaS market
- Fewer features and services
- Historically not as enterprise focused
